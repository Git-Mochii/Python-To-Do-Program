# Python-To-Do-Program

This is a to-do list I made with Python.

This program allows a user to create a task and place it within a to-do list.

The program uses a dictionary to link strings with functions which then makes it so that the program automatically only has to validate certain inputs e.g. the valid
commands that the user is presented within the help list. If the user inputs anything that is not either a command or correctly associated with a command, for example,
'adad' or 'create {but no task description}' then the program will display the appropriate error handling message.

Task Description = Example: {create} Buy Food 

List of Functions
=================
The program has 5 separate functions:

- 'quit' - This command exits the user from the program and displays an output "good-bye" message
- 'help' - This command outputs a small list of commands that are available to the user
- 'create' - This command allows a user to create a task with a small naming description
- 'delete' - This command grabs the task naming description and removes it from the list
- 'list' - This command prints out the list of tasks that the user has created
